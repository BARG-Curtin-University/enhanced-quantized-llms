# Enhanced-Quantized-LLMs

This repository contains the source code and materials for the comparative study
titled "Expanding the Horizons of Large Language Models: A Comparative Study of Fine-Tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Hybrid Techniques". This study examines methods for enhancing the capabilities of smaller, quantized large language models through fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, and their combination.

## Overview

The comparative study covers the following key topics:

- **Fine-Tuning**: Exploring strategies to adapt quantized LLMs to specific tasks or datasets through targeted training.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Investigating how RAG can be integrated with quantized models to dynamically incorporate external information into responses.
- **Hybrid Techniques**: Assessing the combination of fine-tuning and RAG to optimize performance and utility in quantized LLMs.
- **Model Efficiency and Performance**: Detailed analysis of the trade-offs involved in model quantization versus capability expansion.
- **Future Research Directions**: Suggestions for further research in enhancing quantized models, including areas like incremental learning, adaptive retrieval strategies, and efficiency improvements.
